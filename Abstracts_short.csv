Stephanie,,Avery-Gomm,stephanie.averygomm@gmail.com,@saverygo,Yes,Yes,Australia,10+,University of Queensland,PhD student,Using historical data to elucidate global seabird population trends,"The migratory nature of many seabirds necessitates that conservation occurs at an international scale, but efforts are often hindered by fragmented trend info based on country- or global-level assessments. Here we introduce a new global effort to collate data on monitored (surveyed >5 times) breeding populations. This database collates 50+ existing sources and will support analyses of population change and a spatially explicit model of how seabird populations have changed over the past 65 years.",Yes

Jaimie,,Cleeland,jaimie.cleeland@utas.edu.au,@JaimieCleeland,Yes,Yes,Australia,10,University of Tasmania,PhD student,"Albatross, rabbits and extreme weather","Invasive species and climate change present major threats to island ecosystems. Using 20 years of demographic data from 3 sympatric albatross species, we quantify the influence of rabbits and extreme weather on breeding probability and success. Rabbit density explained negative trends in breeding probability of all 3 species and when combined with heavy rainfall, reduced breeding success of black-browed albatross. Encouragingly, a positive response has followed the recent removal of pests.",Yes
David,P.,Craig,dpcraig@willamette.edu,@DavidPCraig,Yes,Yes,Ireland,-5,Willamette University,"Professor, PI",Migratory Connectivity of North American Caspian Tern (Hydroprogne caspia) Populations,"Migratory connectivity of Caspian Terns (Hydroprogne caspia) was investigated using individuals marked in N Am between 1922-2015. Results support recent genetic work describing 3 breeding regions. Further, our results show strong migratory connectivity of Pacific breeders to wintering regions in central & w Mexico, & connectivity of Great Lakes breeders to wintering regions in the Gulf of Mexico & Caribbean. This analysis should help manage the species and contributes to its natural history.",Yes
Kyle,,Elliott,kyle.elliott@mcgill.ca,@ArcticEcology,Yes,Yes,Canada,Eastern Time,McGill University,Assistant Professor,When Scientists Are A Drag,"Seabirds' lives are, well, about the sea. The invention of miniature biologgers transformed our understanding of the 'sea' part of seabirds' lives. However, attachment of biologgers can also disrupt seabirds' lives: increasing hydro/aerodynamic drag, reducing foraging performance, increasing stress, causing reproductive failure and sometimes killing the birds themselves. I will present evidence for all of the above, and provide some recommendations on how to minimize such effects.",Yes
Julia,,Gulka,juliagulka@gmail.com,@julia_gulka,Yes,Unsure,Canada,Central Time,University of Manitoba,M.Sc. student,High Individual Variation in the Foraging Ecology of Breeding Common Murres,"We studied the short-term consistency in foraging behavior of breeding common murres in Newfoundland, comparing inter- and intra-individual variation in foraging trip characteristics using GPS tracking. Most variation was explained by the individual (74-100%), with higher core foraging area overlap among individuals (avg. 35%) than within individuals (avg. 9%). This low individual-level temporal consistency and high population-level similarity suggests flexibility under changing prey conditions.",Yes
Falk,,Huettmann,fhuettmann@alaska.edu,@FalkHuettmann,Yes,Yes,USA,-9  Alaska,University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF),Associate Professor,"Pelagic Seabird Occurrence and Abundance Estimations using GIS, Presence-Absence, Distance Sampling, Machine Learning, Open Access and Open Source: Examples, Roadblocks and Progress","Occurrence and abundance of seabirds remains a crucial but widely missing piece of information for Wildlife Managers. While presence/absence  data are relatively easy to achieve, abundance surveys using line transects and Distance Sampling software remain controversial. 
Here I provide citations and first-hand examples from around the world showing that seabird survey methods got stuck in ideology but that they can easily be resolved with modern approaches for a much improved ocean management.

Ignacio,,Juarez,ijuarez.research@gmail.com,@Leeburro,Yes,Yes,Spain,UTC+1,Oxford University,MSc(Res),Correcting GLS's latitudinal bias around the equinox periods,"Light-level geolocation or GLS it is a very widespread seabird tracking technique despite its unreliability around the equinox periods. As this usually coincides precisely with the time of migration, datapoint deletion needs to be well thought. Here I describe a new method to decide on which datapoints are affected and even to rescue some of them. This results on a reduction of 60% less datapoints on average and an error or 4 degrees of latitude in these periods.",Yes
Thomas,,Mattern,t.mattern@eudyptes.net,@TawakiProject,Yes,Yes,New Zealand,12,University of Otago,Research Scientist,"Penguin hunting jellyfish: main course, side dish or decoration?",Recent studies using DNA analysis and animal-borne cameras indicate that jellyfish may play a more important role in the diet of seabirds than the analysis of stomach contents suggest. But what role is this? Do birds consume jellies as a normal part of their diet or only when other food is scarce? While studying the foraging behavior of Yellow-eyed penguins using high-definition video loggers during a jelly bloom we found an alternative explanation for the birds’ interest in jellies.,Yes
Mark,,Miller,mark.miller1@my.jcu.edu.au,@lark_gorilla,Yes,Unsure,Rwanda,UTC+2,"James Cook University, Australia",PhD student,Investigating tropical seabird foraging ecology with novel data in Australia,"Tropical seabirds are understudied relative to their higher latitude cousins. The oceanography and ecology of the tropics favours different seabird foraging strategies than those dominant in temperate and polar zones. We use a booby, a shearwater and novel data and analyses to investigate foraging, specifically tuna reliance, in the Coral and Tasman seas of Australia.",Yes
Kristina,,Noreikiene,kriste.noreikiene@gmail.com,@Snaudale,Yes,Yes,Estonia,UTC+2,University of Helsinki,"PhD, recent graduate",Nest cover and faecal glucocorticoid metabolites are linked to hatching success and telomere length in breeding eiders (Somateria mollissima),"Glucocorticoids could mediate the adjustment of escape responses to the extent of crypsis provided by the habitat. Here, we examined how nest cover and immunoreactive faecal glucocorticoid metabolite levels (fGCM) are linked to hatching success and telomere length in breeding female eiders (Somateria mollissima). Results of this study provides the first evidence of habitat-dependent moderation of the relationships between stress physiology, telomere length and hatching success.",Yes

Using machine learning for seabird distribution and the framework of telecoupling we present a holistic look at the dynamic fisheries and seabird interactions. Telecoupling can serve as a new sophisticated study template highlighting wider complexities, bottlenecks and sensitivities for a vastly improved conservation research on oceans and global sustainability questions.",No
Pia,,Ricca,piaricca@gmail.com,@Pia_Ricca,Yes,Unsure,Thailand,7,University of Aberdeen,MSc Student,"Geolocation and at-sea activity reveals dispersal strategies and exposure to anthropogenic pressures of an Atlantic seabird, the black-legged kittiwake (Rissa Trydactyla)","Pressures during the nonbreeding season may impact seabird breeding success and population demographics. The nonbreeding season is also a time to replace feathers and restore energy reserves, where seabirds can be vulnerable to human pressures. This study tracked black-legged kittiwakes from Scotland to understand dispersal patterns, the timing of winter moult, and overlap with anthropogenic impacts. Understanding the dispersal of kittiwakes will improve predictions on the drivers of migration.",Yes
Gail,,Robertson,gsrobertson4@gmail.com,@gsrseabirds,Yes,Yes,UK,BST (UTC+1hour),University of Edinburgh,Post doc,Does foraging behaviour explain interspecific variation in breeding success and total reproductive output in three sympatric seabird species?,"We examined foraging behaviour of Arctic (Sterna paradisaea), Common (Sterna hirundo) and Roseate Terns (Sterna dougallii) breeding on Coquet Island, northeast England using colony-based observations and coincident at-sea visual tracking of foraging birds to quantify interspecific overlap in foraging areas and determine how foraging related to reproductive success. Overlap in foraging areas varied among species, but breeding success was similar. However, Common Terns fledged most chicks.",Yes
Airam,,Rodriguez,airamrguez@ebd.csic.es,@Airam_Rguez,Yes,Yes,Spain,UTC+1,Estacion Biologica de Doñana CSIC,Postdoctoral researcher,Seabird mortality caused by land-based artificial lights,"Light-induced mortality of seabirds is poorly understood. Rescue programs are the most extended mitigation measures, but their information is fragmentary & biased, leading to inaccurate impact estimates. We identified as the most urgent actions: estimation of mortality and impact on populations; assessment of threshold light levels and safe distances from lights; documenting the fate of rescued birds; improvement of rescue campaigns; & research on seabird-friendly lights to reduce attraction",Yes
Christy,N.,Wails,wailscn@gmail.com,@wailscn,Yes,Yes,United States,+12 (New Zealand standard time),Northern Illinois University,PhD student,Seasonal timing of colony attendance by prospecting Crested Auklets as a strategy to maximize fitness,"Young seabirds lack breeding site fidelity and use public info to choose habitat. We explored Crested Auklet colony attendance by visually manipulating productivity. Auklets recognized models but attendance was not affected. Accurate colony info occurs during fledging but auklets may use hatching success. Staying at sea during molt may maximize auklet fitness by increasing migratory condition and thus survival and later reproduction. However, climate anomalies threatens this strategy's utility.",Yes
