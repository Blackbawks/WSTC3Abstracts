Hg contamination is a global issue, with effects on reproductive success. Aquatic predator species are the most at risk of Hg contamination and Leachâ€™s storm-petrels (Oceanodroma leucorhoa) of Atlantic Canada have higher levels of Hg than seabirds of the same region. We examined effects of Hg on reproduction in a population of Leachâ€™s storm-petrels from Nova Scotia, and found no correlation.",No

The aim of this study was to quantify the number of seabirds stranded on the beaches of the Coquimbo bay. Over a period of 13 months a total of 395 individuals of dead seabirds were found corresponding to 21 species. The highest percentage of birds found corresponds to diving birds or semi-diving that feed on anchovy, principal target species in purse seine fishing activity.",Yes
